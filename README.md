# Studying JS As A beginners
This is my first GitHub repository with repo name github. Using git is awesome. Lets Start, As far as I concern I have the pleasure
to say Javascript is the new Lingua Fransisco. New Language of the programming world
Its not most often taught to us where we start programming.But I prefer learning it firstPure Javascript is very less to the existing once.
would be the best choice one could have.

Before I start I should credit Mr. **Yohan Gomez** from Zone24x7 for teaching me the correct Javascript

Here I will be considering syntax, data-type  conditions, loops, and 
*   Syntax
*   Data-Types
*   Conditions
*   Loops
*   Classess
*   OOP concepts


Starting it simple will be the best guide to understand core and to enable the primary 
coding practise everyday

This will contain all about the Javascript fundamentals that I have studied during 
my class periods and leisure.
